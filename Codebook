This document describes the code in run_analysis.R.

Each step of the code is described in comments succeeding the line.

<b>X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test<\b>
Dataset files from UCI HAR are read and saved according to the file name.

<b>X_all, y_all<\b>
X and y testing and training data, respectively, are combined using bind_rows()

<b>features<\b>
The features of the data from features.txt are saved using read.table()
The columns of the X data is renamed to the data features using names(X_all)

<b>subject_ID<\b>
Subject IDs of the training and testing sets are saved in subject_train and subject_test using read.table().
subject_train and subject_test are bound using bind_rows() so all IDs are in one table

<b>activity_labels<\b>
Names of the activities of the study are saved using read.table()

<b>subject_activity, activity<\b>
Activity labels are given to appropriate numeric notation on Y data using full_join()
and the new, correctly indexed activity column is saved to 'activity'

<b>subject_activity_df<\b>
A new dataframe is created with the subject activity and IDs using data.frame()
